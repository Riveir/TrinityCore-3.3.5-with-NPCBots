This should work on most versions of trinitycore that are 3.3.5.

There is a dbc file for your server, a patch file for your client and the .sql file(s) to be imported to your db. 

"IF" you're already running a server using portal master such as Skuly's, Ziacopx (if he's still using it) or Khyles you "DO NOT NEED TO APPLY" Trinity_Portal_Master.

"IF" you're not running a server with Trinity_Portal_Master "THEN" run that .sql first and in both cases you will run the TrinityCorePersonalTeleporter.sql.

If you teleport from continent to continent the cooldown timer may not show after teleportation. Don't be alarmed it's normal. The cooldown on the portal and the portal stone 
in your inventory is thirty seconds. If you quickly try and use it after teleportation and see "this spell is not ready" warning wait another twenty seconds for the cooldown 
to finish. 

How to obtain the inventory item. 

1. Every new character created will recieve the pocket portal item in thier inventory.

2. On an existing character you will need to use a gm command to add the item or have a GM add it for you.

Pocket Portal id = 701002 

"BUT, BUT RIVEIR" I have ARAC installed on my server as well! 

I have made provisions to cover all the expected race and class combinations you might find in ARAC ensuring all characters will get a Pocket Portal item.
